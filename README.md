Just a simple tool generates Australian Government Branding primarily in SVG format. It ~~can~~ will also export in PNG format targeted for various social media platforms.

It follows the guidelines published by the [Digital Transformation Agency](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/guides-and-tools/requirements-australian-government-websites/branding) and the [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/australian-government-branding-guidelines-use-australian-government-logo-australian-government-departments-and-agencies).

This should prove handy during Machinery of Government changes or when setting up new social media accounts for various agencies.

It is built using design system react components by the [Department of Agriculture](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next).

### Getting started

"Use of the Commonwealth Coat of Arms without permission may breach the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, the Trade Marks Act 1995 and the Criminal Code Act 1995."

Naturally this tool is aimed at those in the public service who have permission to use government branding. 

So if you're in the private sector, unless you want a collective noun of angry lawyers from the Attorney General's Department, please seek permission from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet first.

Speaking of which, it'd nice if PM&C actually returned my email. Please don't sue me ðŸ˜Š
